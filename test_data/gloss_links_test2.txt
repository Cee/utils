            Building a Course Site
        </h1>

        <p>
        What follows are the steps needed to build a course site with 
        our current course building system.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Each course contains a <i>makefile</i> in its main directory.
                This uses the <i>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make
                    </a>
                </i>
                utility and a number of rules
                to build various targets. We will discuss two targets here:
                <i>local</i> and <i>website</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our courses use "ptml" files (pre-html) to include
                various common or script-generated components in
                target html files. Always edit a ptml file, not an 
                html file.
            </li>
            <li>
                After editing the ptml file, run 'make local' to build
                the html file. This will run an html-code checker first,
                and then run an AWK script that includes other content
                than the ptml file in the final product (the html file).
                If the code checker reports errors, the build will
                stop, and you will have to fix the errors before
                the html file will build.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you get a good build, test your local version of
                the html file in a browser (by using
                'file:///path-to-your-file') and see if it looks
                like you want it to. Check links, make sure images
                load, videos play, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you have verified your work is correct, you
                can re-build the online website by running
                'make website'.
            </li>
            <li>
                The final step is to check the online version and
                make sure it, too, works as you intended.
            </li>
        </ul>
